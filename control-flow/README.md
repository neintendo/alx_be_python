# Control Flow & Loops.

### weather_advice.py

- a Python script that asks the user about the current weather conditions and provide clothing recommendations based on the input.

### match_case_calculator.py 

- a Python script that prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
  The script will then perform the selected operation using a Match Case statement and display the result.

### multiplication_table.py 

- a Python script that asks the user to enter a number, then use a for loop to print the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.

### pattern_drawing.py 

- a Python script that prompts the user to enter a positive integer, then use nested loops to print a square pattern of that size made of asterisks (*).

### daily_reminder.py 

- a Python script that asks the user for a single task, its priority level, and if it is time-sensitive. The program will then provide a customized
  reminder for that task, demonstrating control flow and loops without relying on data structures to store multiple tasks.
