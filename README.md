# ALX Backend Engineering.

## python_introduction.

*Objectives:*
- Understand what Python is and its key characteristics as a high-level programming language.
- Identify common application areas where Python is used.
- Install Python and set up a development environment.
- Learn the importance of indentation in Python for clean, readable code.
- Write and run basic Python programs following proper syntax.

## control-flow.

This project explores control flow and loops â€” essential concepts for adding logic and automation to your Python programs.

*Objectives:*
- Understand control flow and its importance in programming.
- Use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to make decisions in your code.
- Learn about Match Case statements (Python 3.10+) as an alternative to multiple if/elif blocks for clearer, efficient condition handling.
- Explore different types of loops:
    - `for` loops: iterate over sequences like lists, tuples, and strings.
    - `while` loops: repeat tasks while a condition is true.
    - Nested loops: work with multi-dimensional data and patterns.

## fns_and_dsa.

This project delves into the fundamentals of functions, data structures, and modules in Python.

*Objectives:*
- Define the purpose and importance of functions in Python programming.
- Construct functions using `def` and `lambda` keywords, understanding proper syntax.
- Work with function parameters, argument passing mechanisms, default values, and keyword arguments.
- Explain the concept of return values and utilize the `return` statement effectively.
- Distinguish between local and global variable scope within functions.
- Apply `global` and `nonlocal` keywords appropriately to manage variable scope.
- Identify common Python data structures: Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries.
- Select the appropriate data structure based on the type of data and operations needed.
- Perform operations on Lists (indexing, slicing, appending, etc.).
- Utilize Dictionary methods, understand the immutability of Tuples, and perform Set operations.
- Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python.
- Create and use custom modules, and import standard modules provided by Python.
- Install and use external Python libraries using `pip`.
- Identify some essential Python libraries and their functionalities (e.g., `requests`).
- Comprehend the LEGB rule (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) for understanding variable scope in Python.
- Implement best practices for effective variable scope management.
- Explain the concept of namespaces in Python and differentiate between their types.
- Describe the lifecycle of a namespace and how scope resolution works in Python.
