## python_introduction.

*Objectives:*
- Understand what Python is and its key characteristics as a high-level programming language.
- Identify common application areas where Python is used.
- Install Python and set up a development environment.
- Learn the importance of indentation in Python for clean, readable code.
- Write and run basic Python programs following proper syntax.

## control-flow.

This project explores control flow and loops â€” essential concepts for adding logic and automation to your Python programs.

*Objectives:*
- Understand control flow and its importance in programming.
- Use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to make decisions in your code.
- Learn about Match Case statements (Python 3.10+) as an alternative to multiple if/elif blocks for clearer, efficient condition handling.
- Explore different types of loops:
    - `for` loops: iterate over sequences like lists, tuples, and strings.
    - `while` loops: repeat tasks while a condition is true.
    - Nested loops: work with multi-dimensional data and patterns.
